[20]\n\nFor example, anti-freeze is regularly replaced during a service, and washer fluid is generated during the cleaning and servicing of vehicles. Antifreeze is a coolant fluid used in motor vehicles that is also known as Ethylene glycol. This is poisonous to animals and humans. Washer fluid is generated from washing vehicles and auto parts. It is mostly made up of water with oils, heavy metals and detergents also being part of the mixture.[7] "}, "BE07-C-G-H-3": {"value": false, "notes": null}, "BE07-C-G-H-4": {"value": false, "notes": null}, "BE07-C-G-L-1": {"value": false, "notes": null}, "BE07-C-G-L-2": {"value": false, "notes": null}, "BE07-C-E-H-1": {"value": false, "notes": null}, "BE07-C-E-L-1": {"value": false, "notes": null}, "BE08-C-G-H-1": {"value": false, "notes": null}, "BE08-C-G-H-2": {"value": false, "notes": null}, "BE08-C-G-L-1": {"value": true, "notes": "Repair services take place in service stations and auto garages that are situated in urban areas due to higher vehicle concentration in urban areas."}, "BE08-C-E-H-1": {"value": false, "notes": null}, "BE08-C-E-L-1": {"value": false, "notes": null}, "BE09-C-G-H-1": {"value": false, "notes": null}, "BE09-C-G-H-2": {"value": false, "notes": null}, "BE09-C-G-H-3": {"value": false, "notes": null}, "BE09-C-G-H-4": {"value": false, "notes": null}, "BE09-C-G-H-5": {"value": false, "notes": null}, "BE09-C-G-L-1": {"value": false, "notes": null}, "BE09-C-E-H-1": {"value": false, "notes": null}, "BE09-C-E-L-1": {"value": false, "notes": null}, "BE10-C-G-H-1": {"value": true, "notes": "VOCs and paint fumes from painting and exhaust emissions from running engines can cause respiratory discomfort and breathing-related illnesses.

Antiknock agents are commonly used by mechanics to improve the fuel efficiency of an engine. The main component of antiknock is MMT. MMT is a common cause of liver and kidney malfunctions. The combustion of MMT causes the airborne production of manganese. Manganese is another potentially dangerous compound. Employees are at risk of suffering from central nervous system health issues when manganese finds its way into their bloodstream through their lungs when inhaled. The long term effects cause impaired neurological functions. Lead dust and fumes can cause damage to the neurological system.
